Bitbucks is a clone of Bitcoin, with a rapidly accelerated inflation 
schedule. It features a 20-fold increase in basic block subsidy with minutely
spacing, compensated by a halving event that occurs on a weekly basis.

In short, Bitbucks is an economic experiment that features the original
Bitcoin protocol on steroids- converting lengthy 4-year halving periods into
weekly events. All while retaining the original maximum supply cap.
Bitbucks allows us to witness a century-long inflation process condensed
into the span of 6 months.
